1. How does the script handle arguments and options?

- First, it uses getopts to parse the options -n, -v, and --help.

- After parsing options, it uses shift to remove them from the arguments.

- Then, it takes the next two arguments: the search string and the filename.

- It checks if both are provided; if anything is missing, it shows an error and prints the help message.

- If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it prints an error and exits.

- It builds a grep command dynamically based on the selected options.

2. If I were to add support for regex or options like -i, -c, -l:

- I would extend the option parsing to detect these additional flags.

- Depending on the flags, I would adjust the grep command:

- -c would make it print only the number of matching lines.

- -l would make it print only the filename if it contains matches.

- I would probably create a dynamic array of options and pass them all at once to grep at the end.

3. What was the hardest part and why?

- The hardest part was correctly handling the options parsing, especially when combining options like -vn or -nv.

- Also, making sure the script validates all necessary inputs properly before executing the grep command to avoid runtime errors.
